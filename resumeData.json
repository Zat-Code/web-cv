        "description":"This course aims to train specialists in software and hardware architecture for signal processing and more particularly for image processing. For this, the initial knowledge base is primarily centered on digital electronics and embedded computing. The second year of the master allows a specialization towards systems dedicated to image processing (FPGA, DSP), as well as a solid training in image processing and artificial vision.  In the end, the core of the professions targeted by the SETSIS course concerns the development of embedded architecture on reconfigurable targets (FPGA) for real-time image processing which, according to OPIIEC (observatory of digital, engineering, research and consulting professions), is one of the skills most sought after by professionals."
